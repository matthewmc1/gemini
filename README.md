**Foundations**

- **Systems thinking**
    
    - **Example:** Analyze the dependencies within a legacy application by creating a component/relationship map. This showcases how changes propagate and bottlenecks occur.
    - **Project Idea:** Identify a process with repetitive manual work (e.g., server reboots, certificate renewals). Create a diagram using systems thinking to model the steps, inputs, and outputs, then target areas for automation or improvement.
    
- **Reliability Engineering**
    
    - **Example:** Read Google's SRE book ([https://sre.google/books/](https://sre.google/books/)). The case studies illustrate real-world applications of reliability concepts.
    - **Project Idea:** Establish SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for a small web service (even a test-bed one). Practice determining appropriate metrics (latency, error rate, availability). Build a simple dashboard to visualize them.
    
- **Performance Engineering**
    
    - **Example:** Use Apache JMeter or k6 to generate load against a simple application. Identify breaking points and analyze results.
    - **Project Idea:** Use profiling tools to optimize a piece of code. Choose a performance bottleneck area you understand well, use a profiler to diagnose where time is spent, and make targeted code changes.
    
- **Scalability**
    
    - **Example:** Deploy a test application on a cloud platform like AWS or GCP. Utilize load balancers and auto-scaling to experiment with the service's capacity.
    - **Project Idea:** Simulate load in a test environment to trigger auto-scaling rules. Observe how resources adjust, find weaknesses in your scaling configuration, and iterate to improve.
    
- **Security**
    
    - **Example:** Learn OWASP Top 10 ([https://owasp.org/Top10/](https://owasp.org/Top10/)) to understand common vulnerabilities.
    - **Project Idea:** Perform a vulnerability scan on a purposefully "buggy" web application. Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Nikto to discover security flaws.
    
- **Chaos engineering**
    
    - **Example:** Read "Chaos Engineering" by Casey Rosenthal and Nora Jones.
    - **Project Idea:** In a controlled test environment, introduce a minor fault. For example, simulate network latency in a service dependency by using tools like `tc` or Gremlin. Watch how the system responds and adapt your error handling.
    

**Tools**

- **Monitoring tools**
    
    - **Example:** Set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from a test application.
    - **Project Idea:** Add custom metrics related to business functions in the test application, then design alerts and dashboards in Prometheus and Grafana.
    
- **Logging tools**
    
    - **Example:** Implement the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to centralize logs.
    - **Project Idea:** Write a script to parse log files for specific errors. Send automated alerts on patterns of repeated failures.
    
- **Configuration management tools**
    
    - **Example:** Use Ansible or Terraform to provision a new virtual machine in the cloud.
    - **Project Idea:** Write an Ansible playbook to deploy a test application across multiple nodes consistently.
    
- **Other tools** (choose a focus from incident management, alerting, automation to specialize)
